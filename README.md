# Backup Roam

Regularly backup a [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) database to this git repository.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based heavily on [roam-backup](https://github.com/signalnerve/roam-backup). The differences are:

- I use markdown backups instead of json
- The backups are saved to this git repository instead of AWS
